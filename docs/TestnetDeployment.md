# Testnet Deployment Guide

Step-by-step guide to deploy CKB Kickstarter to the CKB testnet (Pudge).

## Prerequisites

- Contracts built (`scripts/build-contracts.sh`)
- Node.js 18+, npm installed
- All `npm install` completed in `off-chain/frontend`, `off-chain/indexer`, and `off-chain/transaction-builder`

## 1. Get a Funded Testnet Account

### Generate a key (if you don't have one)

Use `ckb-cli` or any CKB wallet to generate a keypair:

```bash
ckb-cli account new
```

Save the private key securely. You'll need it as `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY`.

### Get testnet CKB from the faucet

1. Visit https://faucet.nervos.org/
2. Enter your testnet address (starts with `ckt1...`)
3. Request CKB — you need approximately **100,000 CKB** for deploying both contracts

Contract binaries are typically 50–200 KB each, and each byte requires ~1 CKB of capacity.

## 2. Build Contracts

```bash
bash scripts/build-contracts.sh
```

The same RISC-V binaries work on all CKB networks. Output:
- `contracts/campaign/target/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/release/campaign-contract`
- `contracts/pledge/target/riscv64imac-unknown-none-elf/release/pledge`

## 3. Deploy Contracts

```bash
cd off-chain/transaction-builder

CKB_NETWORK=testnet \
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE \
npx ts-node ../../scripts/deploy-contracts.ts
```

This will:
- Deploy both campaign and pledge contracts to testnet
- Wait for each transaction to confirm (~10 seconds per block)
- Save results to `deployment/deployed-contracts-testnet.json`
- Print the environment variables you need

Example output:
```
=== Deployment Complete ===
{
  "network": "testnet",
  "campaign": {
    "codeHash": "0xb71c1c...",
    "txHash": "0xabc123...",
    "index": 0
  },
  "pledge": {
    "codeHash": "0x423442...",
    "txHash": "0xdef456...",
    "index": 0
  }
}
```

## 4. Start the Indexer

```bash
cd off-chain/indexer

CKB_RPC_URL=https://testnet.ckbapp.dev/ \
CAMPAIGN_CODE_HASH=0xb71c1c... \
PLEDGE_CODE_HASH=0x423442... \
npm run dev
```

Or create an `off-chain/indexer/.env` file:

```env
CKB_RPC_URL=https://testnet.ckbapp.dev/
CAMPAIGN_CODE_HASH=0xb71c1c...
PLEDGE_CODE_HASH=0x423442...
PORT=3001
DB_PATH=./data/indexer-testnet.db
```

The indexer will poll the testnet every 10 seconds for new campaign/pledge cells.

## 5. Start the Frontend

```bash
cd off-chain/frontend

NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet \
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPAIGN_CODE_HASH=0xb71c1c... \
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPAIGN_TX_HASH=0xabc123... \
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLEDGE_CODE_HASH=0x423442... \
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLEDGE_TX_HASH=0xdef456... \
npm run dev
```

Or create an `off-chain/frontend/.env.local` file:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPAIGN_CODE_HASH=0xb71c1c...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CAMPAIGN_TX_HASH=0xabc123...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLEDGE_CODE_HASH=0x423442...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PLEDGE_TX_HASH=0xdef456...
```

On testnet the frontend will:
- Show a blue "Testnet" badge instead of the orange "Devnet" badge
- Show "Connect Wallet" button instead of the devnet account switcher
- Use the CCC wallet connector for JoyID / MetaMask

## 6. Connect a Wallet

1. Open the frontend in your browser
2. Click **Connect Wallet**
3. Choose JoyID or MetaMask (via CCC connector)
4. Make sure your wallet is on the CKB testnet

## 7. Test the Full Lifecycle

1. **Create a campaign** — set a title, goal (>= 100 CKB), and deadline block
2. **Pledge CKB** — switch to a different wallet / account and pledge
3. **Wait for deadline** — or set a deadline close to the current block
4. **Finalize** — the creator finalizes the campaign
5. **Release / Refund** — depending on success or failure
6. **Destroy** — creator reclaims the campaign cell's CKB

## Differences from Devnet

| Aspect | Devnet | Testnet |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Block time | Instant | ~8-10 seconds |
| Wallet | Auto-connected test accounts | Real wallet (JoyID, MetaMask) |
| CKB | Pre-funded 42M CKB | Faucet (limited) |
| RPC | `http://127.0.0.1:8114` | `https://testnet.ckbapp.dev/` |
| System scripts | OFFCKB overrides | CCC built-in testnet scripts |

## Troubleshooting

### "Balance may be insufficient" during deployment
Request more CKB from the faucet. Each contract needs ~50,000 CKB.

### Transaction not confirming
Testnet blocks take ~8-10 seconds. The deploy script waits up to 120 seconds. If it times out, check the transaction on [CKB Testnet Explorer](https://pudge.explorer.nervos.org/).

### Indexer not finding cells
Make sure `CAMPAIGN_CODE_HASH` and `PLEDGE_CODE_HASH` match the deployment output. Code hashes are deterministic (same binary = same hash), but tx hashes are unique per deployment.

### Wallet won't connect
- Ensure your wallet supports CKB testnet
- JoyID: works out of the box on testnet
- MetaMask: requires the CKB Snap or PW-Core bridge

### "Cannot resolve creator lock script"
The indexer needs to re-index after the database migration. Delete the old `indexer.db` and restart, or wait for the next polling cycle.
